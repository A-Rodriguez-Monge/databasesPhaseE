Modifications:
	Some queries have minor changes to be better visualized.
	Some data errors were corrected

Process:
	see Phase C

Successes:
	1. Maps: formatting data correctly from queries to present it on the map + adding functionality
	2. State Relation: Finding lots of different data and connecting/formatting it to fit well

Known Issues:
      1. Some outliers in dataset which skews some visualizations
      	 ex: testing-death rate has much higher values for smaller countries		due to their smaller populations

      2. Some missing data points
      	 ex: China should have more than 0 hospitalizations

      3. Afghanistan Isocode does not load correctly
      	 raw data is fine, but when loaded, it is turned to a weird character


Extensions:
	1. Pull more date from real-time sources
	2. Clean up UI and make website more concise
	3. Expand 'state' table to different countries
